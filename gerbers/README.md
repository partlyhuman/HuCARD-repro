# HuCARD
Hucard gerbers ready for fab.

Hucard thickness need to be around ~2.4mm

TSOP is on the bottom side

You need to add a 2nd layer (plastic for example) to ensure thickness as PBC tends to be 2mm at maximum.

TSOP can be :
- 39SF0x0 series (SST/Microchip short "32 pins") - up to 4Mbits / 512kB, 
- 29F0x0 series (AMD and other brands, "long" 32 pins) - up to 4Mbits / 512kB,
- 29F080 40 pins - 8Mbits / 1MB

TSOP can also be (re)flashed after soldering (/WE flash connected to /WE bus)
