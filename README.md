This is a fork of @ichigobankai's excellent [reproduction HuCards](https://github.com/ichigobankai/HuCARD-repro-gerbers).

The goals of this fork are:
1. Archive Ichigo's hard work so it's not lost
2. Add accessories I've developed while using Ichigo's designs

# Changelog

* Archived Ichigo's [original post](original-post/)
* Archived Ichigo's [HuConv program](HuCONV_v1.5/) to prepare images for flashing
* Created and added [templates](prints/) of my design including
	* A vector file for cutting vinyl to mimic the UV protection coating
	* A PSD template for making replica HuCard stickers
	* A 3d print for risers
* Gathered the original gerbers from root into a [gerbers folder](gerbers/)
* **NEW!** Added a [programming adapter](HuCard-TL866/) for use with the popular TL866 II programmer
* **In progress** Started to reverse engineer the gerbers into a Kicad project. Will probably relayout things so this isn't a shameless clone.

Please note that the development of this PCB and all credit aside from the prints goes to https://github.com/ichigobankai/. Their original [LICENSE](LICENSE) continues to apply.
